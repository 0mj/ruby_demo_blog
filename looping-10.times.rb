The .times Iterator

The .times method is like a super compact for loop: it can perform a task on each item in an object a specified number of times.

For example, if we wanted to print out "Chunky bacon!" ten times, we might type
=end

10.times do
  puts "--------------------PANCAKE------------------------------"
end
