# Hash https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.0/Hash.html
# A Hash maps each of its unique keys to a specific value.

# A Hash has certain similarities to an Array, but:

# An Array index is always an Integer.

# A Hash key can be (almost) any object.

# Hash Data Syntax
# The older syntax for Hash data uses the "hash rocket" =>:

h = {:foo => 0, :bar => 1, :baz => 2} # => {:foo=>0, :bar=>1, :baz=>2}
